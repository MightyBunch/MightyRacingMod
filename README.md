# MightyRacingMod

## Overview

MightyRacingMod is a Minecraft mod designed to enhance your boat racing experience. It introduces new commands and uses command blocks to manage race tracks. With MightyRacingMod, you can easily set up and manage boat races, while the scoreboard feature keeps track of all the important race statistics, displaying a comprehensive raceboard for all drivers.

## Features

- **Raceboard**: Uses the scoreboard to display driver standings, their on-track position and their fastest lap in real-time! (see it the 'Preview')
- **Lap Time Display**: Displays the current lap time and the intervals from their best lap above the inventory. (see it the 'Preview')
- **Commands**: Adds a variety of commands to help set up Practice, Qualification and Grand Prix. Mod utilizes command blocks to setup race track - with them you can create sectors, finish line and even the pitlane. All commands for this mod start with /mightyracing.
- **Fully server-side**: Doesn't requires installation on the client-side, as it doesn't use any custom interfaces or new blocks but utilizes command blocks and scoreboard.
